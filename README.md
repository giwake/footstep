A simple system for footsteps in GZDoom. Very janky but very fun. Inspired by System Shock 2 (in how footsteps get faster the faster you run) and Half Life (in how the view rolls when you land)
Define new steps for different terrains in the terrain lump like this:
```
terrain MyCoolTerrain
{
	RightStepSounds		"player/CoolStep"
}
```

[A video demonstrating the footstep system, as well as the view roll when landing is available here](https://file.garden/ZeqLdBGi9H-cAZ8I/bandicam%202024-03-14%2001-03-45-881.mp4)
